This research develops an artificial intelligence solution for efficiently
sorting good and damaged African pears, a crop of great significance in the West African region. We
trained a model for detecting objects using the YOLOv5 algorithm on a dataset of about 2900 African
pear images to predict imperfect surfaces. The dataset included two classes: good pears and bad pears,
with 870 and 2027 images, respectively, and was collected from three regions in Cameroon. The bad
class of pears included those with bruises, cuts, and rot. After oversampling the images in the good
class, the model achieved a mean average precision of 85.1% for detecting damaged and good pear
surfaces, indicating its potential to aid farmers in choosing high-quality produce. By automating a
crucial yet tedious manual process, this technology could increase efficiency and productivity for African
pear farmers through reduced waste, higher crop values, and improved farm incomes. Specifically,
detecting damaged fruit surfaces early can improve harvesting efficiency by removing unmarketable fruit
and reducing labor costs. Additionally, detecting and removing defective fruit before harvesting can
significantly reduce fruit waste throughout the supply chain and improve the overall quality and value
of the crop. These benefits can lead to improved profit margins and farm incomes for African pear
farmers. This research illustrates how merging agriculture and technology through machine learning
and computer vision can help secure livelihoods and cultural heritage for African communities reliant on
vital crops for generations. With refinements incorporating diverse growersâ€™ needs, this method shows
promise as an adaptive, scalable solution to maximize agricultural productivity and sustainability for
smallholder farmers.
